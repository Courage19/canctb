Abstract
Early detection is crucial for effective treatment of diseases like cancer and tuberculosis, and machine learning techniques offer a promising approach for developing automated disease detection systems. This abstract outlines the design and evaluation of a machine learning-based system that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans and detect the presence of cancerous or tuberculosis-affected tissues. The researchers first collected a diverse dataset of medical images, carefully annotated by medical experts, and then trained the CNN models to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues, going through a process of fine-tuning and optimization to achieve high accuracy. The results show that the machine learning-based system can detect cancers and tuberculosis with remarkable accuracy, outperforming traditional diagnostic methods in many cases and providing quick and consistent results to reduce the workload on healthcare professionals. Looking ahead, the researchers plan to further enhance the system by incorporating multimodal data and deploy it in resource-constrained regions to improve access to early disease detection and save lives, showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare through automated diagnosis.
